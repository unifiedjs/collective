# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project
maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at richard@maintainer.io, which will go
only to Richard Littauer, or to liv@fastmail.com, which will go only to Olivia
Hugger.
You may also cc both.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project’s leadership.

In cases where community members transgress against the values in the Code,
members of the Moderation team will use a three-strike warning system, where the
aggressor will be warned twice before they are permanently excluded from our
community spaces.
This code applies to Spectrum, IRC, and GitHub, and any other space that this
community uses for communication.
For interactions between community members outside of this space, the code also
applies if the interactions are reported and deemed to be interfering with
community members safely working on any project together.
Conversations between moderators (when they are more serious than discussing
simple warnings) will occur in private repositories or through email, to ensure
both anonymity for reporters and the safety of the moderators.
