# Project Donation Policy Draft

This document describes how specific projects from outside an organization can
move under a unified collective organization.
It’s a guide for organization teams to follow, but they are free in defining
their own project donation policy instead.

This document is developed by the unified collective core team.

## Glossary

*   **org**
    — unified organization team
*   **inside project**
    — project maintained by an **org**
*   **outside project**
    — project maintained outside of an **org**
*   **member**
    — active member of an **org**
*   **outside maintainer**
    — individual who maintains an **outside project**
*   **outside collaborator**
    — non-member who donated an **outside project** to an **org**

## Applicable Projects

Organization teams maintain several plugins, utilities, or other projects
around their area of expertise.
Such projects can also be maintained outside of an organization: anyone can
develop, maintain, and self-govern projects.

Outside projects can flourish, but sometimes they could benefit from being
inside the organization.
Signs of this are for example that issues are left unanswered or that
dependencies are outdated.

These applicable outside projects can become inside projects, in which case
they are moved under the governance of an organization team.

## Donation procedure

*   Optionally, a **member** may contact an **outside maintainer** to suggest
    donating an applicable **outside project** to an **org**.
    Members may of course also nominate outside collaborators for membership.
    An **outside maintainer** may decline this suggestion
*   An **outside maintainer** may nominate a project they administer for
    donation on the organization’s governance repository (e.g.,
    `remarkjs/governance`).
*   **Members** must review whether adopting the project makes sense and whether
    they accept governance over the repository.
    Provided there are no objections from the members, such requests are
    approved automatically after 72 hours.
    If any objection is made, the request may be moved to a majority vote in
    the core team.
    If the vote rejects the request the donation is denied.
*   The **outside maintainer** should add a **member** to the **outside
    project** on GitHub and npm.
*   **Member**s or **outside collaborators** should make sure the project
    matches **inside projects**, such as having a “Contributing” section,
    a proper license, etc.
*   The **member** will move the project, strip **outside maintainers** of
    their previous rights and configure their new rights as
    **outside collaborators**.

## Outside collaborators

The rights and responsibilities of outside collaborators are described in
`governance.md`.
